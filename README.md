## Description: 
Created a password generator with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.

## Installation:
In order to create a password generator that met the criteria of the user, I created an array that combined all of the characters together after establishing the variables (i.e. special characters, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers). This was all within two functions that ran the code and then placed the newly-generated password into the text-box for the user to see and copy. 

## What is should look like:
